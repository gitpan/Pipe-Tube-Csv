NAME
    Pipe::Tube::Csv - Csv processor tube in Pipe

SYNPOSIS
      my @resp = Pipe->for(@rows)->csv;

      my @resp = Pipe->cat("t/data/file1", "t/data/file2")->csv({ sep_char => "\t" });

DESCRIPTION
    The ->csv() call can get a HASH reference parameter, the same parameter
    as Text::CSV_XS would get. We pass it directly to that module.

    Split up lines of csv file and return an array reference for each line.

    TODO: use the first row as key names and on every other row return a
    hash of the values using the above header
